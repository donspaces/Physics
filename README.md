# Physics
An unreal project which simulates the motion of a bouncing ball in imaginative condition.

# Release 1.7.6
In this release I add a new scene in which a camera is focusing on that scene. There is a pawn in the game which you can control with. It will automatically shot balls once at a time. Players can modify the angle and the position of that pawn.

Control:
W - Move Foward
A - Move Backward
S - Move Left
D - Move Right
Q - Turn Left
E - Turn Right
